Exercise IDF models

On the course page, you will find a folder named “Exercise_Building_model”. Inside, you find six sub-folders
with specific IDFs in line with what we have seen during the last lecture (NOTE: IDF are in EnergyPlus
version 9.4 to be converted to the desired version before modifications or use in BESOS and the other
exercise actions.
Please go to the google spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YY0xUmobplX6tuozecFxsCdH8mk4GHY3DfOAxf_nTo/edit?usp=sharing) and check the name of your IDF.
Finally, you have a folder with TMY (starting weather). Additionally, there is a station with data for Turin on
the weather underground. For the cold climate, check station IKASTR4, while for the hot climate, look for
ISPATA5.

Such as underlined the 8th of October during the lecture on IDF, I synthesised what we discussed together
and fixed it on the board.

Input:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Thermal insulation of walls
Thermal insulation of roof or last slab
Change of the window type: single Sgl, (Double Dbl Air,) Double LoE Arg, Triple Tpl LoE Arg
Set point temperatures
Ventilation rate (schedule nat. vent) – please on summer
Ventilation control thresholds (max out; min in; delta T)
Shading (external or internal blinds) control thresholds (temperature; solar irradiation global
horizontal)
8. Mechanical ventilation rates
9. Type of lighting system
10. Window-to-wall ratio (Eppy or Geomeppy not in the IDF)
11. Others to be discussed together if interesting for you (e.g. scheduling time etc.)

Output (variable to be optimised):
a. Energy indicators:
a. Heating energy needs
b. Cooling energy needs
c. Lighting energy needs
b. Thermal comfort:
a. Indoor temperatures (or indoor operative temperatures)
b. (or PMV/PPD POR or numbers of hours for adaptive thermal comfort thresholds)
c. Others to be discussed together if you have an interest
NOTE:

For the energy needs you need to take for:
-

-

-

Heating: you can use “districtheating”, which is an output that includes heating simple HVAC
output. Please check for residual almost zero values for filtering. Otherwise, you may check per
zone sensible heating points (pay attention in this case; you need to sum the values for all the
zones). This districtheating output is in [J] and refers to the envelope needs (Net energy). It needs
to be first reported to kWh (or kWh/m2) and after divided by the average seasonal COP to retrieve
the energy vector value. If the COP is the one of an electrical unit, this final value is kWh electrical
and may be summed to the other three energy voices (both professors may help you in this
process)
Cooling: you can use the EnergyPlus “districtcooling” output used in simple HVAC models. It is in [J]
and needs again to be transformed in [kWh or in kWh/m2] and divided by a system seasonal COP
to retrieve the electricity kWh values that may be summed with the the lighting ones.
lighting output of EnergyPlus (check the Input/output manual) that expresses the electricity [kWh
or kWh/m2] for lighting. Pay attention if you take equipment or a similar voice that this output
point also includes lighting variations; otherwise is not applicable;

Finally, if all three voices are in electricity, you may sum them up. If one is, for example, in natural gas, all
need to be translated into primary energy values (see UNI/TS 11300). See slides.
