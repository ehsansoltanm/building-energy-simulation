Exercise topics
NOTE: Exercises simulate tangible professional aspects connected to ICT/IT usage in the building
domain.  building management optimisation (operational) & building design choice opt.
Part 1 synthesises three main aspects (Building Design/Rating):
• Support optimising design choices (specific Nexus series follow that)
• Support retrofitting analyses
• Describe building-weather & building-energy correlations till the passage from white to black
box models
Part 2 synthesises ... Main aspects (Building Operation):
• Smart building systems (simulation acts like sensors feeding database)
• Energy/temperature(comfort) forecasting
• BMS data flows (simulation used as sensor/actuator managed via external platforms)

The final exam with relevant scoring will include:
• a test to assess theoretical knowledge acquired during the course (weight:
40% of the final score; duration: 1 h) – consultation of supporting tools and
material is not allowed;
• an evaluation by the teachers of the final results of the exercises carried
out during the course (data, analyses, code and VM) and presented in a
book/report one week before the final exam (weight: 40%);
• a slide presentation of the results of the exercises carried out during the
course and discussion about them to check students’ comprehension of
the learning process (weight: 20%; duration: 20 minutes per student team).
